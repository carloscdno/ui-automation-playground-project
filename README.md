# ðŸ§ª UI Testing Playground Automation with Playwright

This project is a comprehensive test suite built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to automate UI scenarios from the [UI Testing Playground](https://www.uitestingplayground.com/). It demonstrates modern, reliable, and maintainable end-to-end testing practices for common UI challenges â€” such as dynamic elements, overlays, dialogs, shadow DOM, and more.
